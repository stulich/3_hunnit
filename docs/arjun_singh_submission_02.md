I had many contributions. My main contribution on this project was to desdign the discussion deatils, which is when you view a certain discussion.
I also was able to help figure out how to set up the database and what we would need to do in order to pair comments with posts or votes with post.
Also I designed the survery post page which allowed for people to see the posts in a way that matches our layout.
I also was able to help with the survery post design in the code, although stephen did the implementation. With this I was able to help with the mapping with discussion so all comments werent showing all at once.
I made the video and uplaoded it explaining our project.
