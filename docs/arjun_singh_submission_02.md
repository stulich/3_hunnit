My main contribution on this project was to desdign the discussion deatils, which is when you view a certain discussion.
I also was able to help figure out how how to set up the database and what we would need to do in order to pair comments with posts or votes with post.
Also I designed the survery post page which allowed for people to see the posts in a way that matches our layout.
I also was able to help with the survery post setup in the code, although stephen did the implementation.
I also made the video and uplaoded it explaining our video.
