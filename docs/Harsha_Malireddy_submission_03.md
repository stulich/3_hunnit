For this project I implemented the discussion post update. To do this I created the forms: DiscussionPost_form.html, and 
I also created additional forms that will be useful later:  DiscussionPost_confirm_delete.html, SurveyPost_form.html and 
the SurveyPost_confirm_delete.html files.

I implemented the button edit inside the discussiondetail.html files which allow users to edit disucssion posts.

In the views.py files, I added the classes: DiscussionUpdate which would respectively play a part in updating 
a discussion and commented out methods SurveyUpdate, SurveyDelete, DiscussionDelete which will be useful later.
