For this project, one of my main contributions was helping design the data model. At first we all worked on it together, but Stepen and I ended up designing the majority of it. I also created the data model diagram

I also worked on the HTML for the list of discussion posts and specific discussion posts. I also helped add in the URL mapping and the views for those as well. Although Stephen was the one to add comments to the discussion posts. A lot of the work I did on this was scrapped and improved on because we ended up doing more styling than we needed to for this submission.

I also helped plan the video, created the script for the video, and essentially mapped out the structure of the video presentation so that it was easier for Arjun to create the video.
