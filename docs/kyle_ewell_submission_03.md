I contirbuted to ths project submission in a couple of ways. The main thing was working with monmoy using his machine to establish the html which allows users to create discussion posts. Additionally we worked on the implementation for survey posts creation which would also be for the final submission. Finally through the discussion post code Harsha was able to create an update for his portion of the project submission.
