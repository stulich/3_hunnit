I made several contributions to this project. Firstly I set up the django project and helped everyone get to speed on getting the project working on their machines and how to work with the terminal to run the different scripts and commands that made the project work.  I also made major contributions in how the data model would work and implemented basically the entire models.py file. I also wrote the init.py file to make up the mock data and the init.sh file.

I also made large contributions in the views file and the different templates that allowed the views to be shown in the html. The most challenging part of this was to reference the comment sections from the discussion posts and then get the survey post to reference the different choices.

Finally I implemented the url mappings and views that allowed detailed views to be shown for the discussion posts and survey results. This included the html and javascript as well. I did not do the styling for these.
