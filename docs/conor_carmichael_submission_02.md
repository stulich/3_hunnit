I was able to contribute to this project submission in a few different ways. My argest contributions 
came in the HTML and CSS. I designed our base.html page, which mostly consisted of desgining a navbar
that was efficient, and would link to our necessary pages. I also worked on with the html and css for the discussion
post page, and the survey listings page. At first I was helping with the python for views.py, but as our 
plans changed, a bit of the code I had written was no longer needed. I had written functions for some pages,
where we decided to move to listviews, and needed classes. In the discussion and survey pages, I was able to set up the 
template HTML in user friendly ways.
