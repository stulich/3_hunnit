I was able to help the team to finish this run of the project through a few contributions. I was able to solve an
issue that we were running into with authenticating users when submitting a discussion post. I also edited our home page
make logging in and out easier, as well as showing a beginning view for a sidebar to display user information. I also tried
to keep the team on track with communicating in slack. Lastly I worked with Stephen to create the user specific views.
