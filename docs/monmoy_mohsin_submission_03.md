For this submission, my main contribution was writing the code to allow users to add discussion posts to the database, which helped Harsha implement his code to allow users to update their posts. For this part, Kyle and I worked together to figure out the code on my computer, using pair programming methology. While, this was a slow purpose, it really helped both of us understand what we were doing because we had to make sure the other understood what was going on. We also did this for the survey posts but we are still working on that for the final submission.
My other contributions were handling a lot of bugs and small fixes, like adding a link that let users go to their posts, handling the superuser being logged in outside of the admin site, and general fixes to helping the app not crash.
I also helped with some of the functionality decisions, helped with the team write up, and helped Arjun plan the video.
